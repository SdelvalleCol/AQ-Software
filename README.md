Main features:
Access Control: The system can precisely control personal and vehicle access in residential areas. Authorized personnel can manage access rights and track entry and exit logs.
Vehicle access management: The system realizes efficient vehicle access management, including registration, verification and control of vehicle access. This ensures that only authorized vehicles can enter residential areas.

Parameter changes: Authorized personnel can change system parameters such as lighting intensity, temperature settings or security settings to adapt to changing needs and optimize resource utilization.

User role control: The system implements role-based permissions, allowing administrators to assign different levels of access and functions according to the user's role. This ensures proper control and separation of duties within the system.

IPS Access: The system includes features that can seamlessly integrate with IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) to enhance security measures. This integration enables real-time monitoring and alerting of potential security breaches.

Technologies Used:

SQL: The system utilizes SQL databases for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Node.js with Express: The project leverages Node.js and the Express module to build a robust and scalable server-side application.
CSS with Bootstrap: CSS and Bootstrap are used for styling and ensuring a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
HTML with EJS: HTML combined with EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates is used for dynamic web page generation, making the application more interactive.
The Residential Zone Control System, developed using SQL, Node.js (with Express), CSS (Bootstrap), and HTML (EJS), follows a user-server architecture. With its emphasis on access control, vehicle management, parameter modification, user control with roles, and IPS integration, the system aims to provide enhanced security and efficient management within the residential zone.
